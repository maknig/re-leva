          <p>
            <strong>ReLeva</strong> is a personal project focused on designing
            and building a high-performance lever-style espresso machine from
            the ground up. The goal is to combine the tactile, mechanical purity
            of classic lever machines with modern control, measurement, and
            repeatability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The machine is constructed primarily from stainless steel, with a
            glass water reservoir, and uses a custom-designed electronics and
            control system.

          <p>
            ReLeva uses 304/316 stainless steel for its boilers
            and primary thermal components. This material was selected for its
            food safety, corrosion resistance, and long-term durability.
            Compared to copper or aluminum, stainless steel provides higher
            thermal mass, resulting in a slower heat-up phase but improved
            temperature stability once operating conditions are reached. In
            practice, warm-up time remains competitive with — and often faster
            than — many traditional lever machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional lever espresso machines typically operate without a
            pump, favoring mechanical simplicity and purity. ReLeva
            intentionally diverges from this approach by incorporating a pump to
            manage the two boilers independently. This enables automatic boiler
            filling and water-level control, improving usability and safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            In pump-less systems, boiler refilling often relies on fixed water
            plugs, requiring the boiler to cool down before opening — an
            operational compromise that interrupts workflow. By integrating a
            pump, ReLeva preserves the manual lever extraction experience while
            removing these practical limitations.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Dual boiler architecture:</strong> Separate boilers for
              brew water and steam, each temperature-controlled independently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Constant-temperature brewhead:</strong> The brewhead is
              kept at a stable temperature by circulating water from the boiler
              via convection, ensuring consistent extraction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom controller:</strong> Precise temperature
              measurement and control, plus water-level management.

            <li>
              <strong>Bluetooth connectivity:</strong>
              Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for real-time monitoring and
              configuration.

          <h2 id="controller-heading">Controller</h2>
          <p>
            ReLeva uses a custom-designed controller board responsible for PID
            temperature control, boiler water-level regulation, and power
            management. The design prioritizes robustness and measurement
            accuracy.

            <li>
              <strong>Microcontroller</strong><br />
              STM32L431 (ARM Cortex-M4), selected for low power consumption and
              high-quality analog peripherals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heater control</strong><br />
              AC heater control with dedicated zero-cross detection.

        <section aria-labelledby="limitations-heading">
          <h2 id="limitations-heading">Known limitations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Warm-up time:</strong> Due to the high thermal mass of the
              stainless steel boilers and group, initial warm-up is slower
              compared to low-mass copper or aluminum systems. The design
              prioritizes stability over minimum warm-up time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Manual profiling:</strong> Pressure profiling is currently
              purely mechanical via the lever. While this preserves the
              traditional lever experience, it limits repeatability compared to
              actively controlled pressure systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Early-stage firmware:</strong> The control firmware is
              functional but still evolving. Features such as advanced logging,
              fault diagnostics, and calibration tooling are under active
              development.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Single-sensor brew temperature:</strong> Brew temperature
              control is currently based on a limited number of sensors. A
              dedicated brew pressure sensor is in development to improve
              extraction profiling and data correlation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not production-hardened:</strong> This machine is a
              one-off prototype. Mechanical tolerances, wiring, and safety
              systems are designed for experimentation and learning rather than
              certification or mass production.

          <p>
            ReLeva is an ongoing project. Hardware revisions, firmware
            improvements, and documentation updates are actively in progress. A
            pressure sensor is currently in development to profile pressure and
            temperature during coffee extraction.
